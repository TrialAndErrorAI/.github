# Trial and Error Inc 🚀

**We ship what doesn't exist.**

---

## Who We Are

Boston-based builders solving real problems with code. When npm packages return 404, we don't complain - we build.

Founded by engineers who got tired of waiting for "official" solutions that never work.

## What We Build

### 🏗️ Open Source

#### [App Store Connect MCP](https://github.com/TrialAndErrorAI/appstore-connect-mcp)
*20 minutes from idea to production*  
The "official" MCP server didn't exist. Now it does. Connect your iOS metrics to Claude instantly.

### 🎨 Products

#### [RenovateAI](https://renovateai.app) 
The AI that understands architecture. Reimagine any space with AI-powered renovation intelligence.
- iOS & Web Apps
- 90% revenue from iOS
- Real users, real revenue

#### ProcessBot
Intelligent automation that actually works. Because copy-paste is not a strategy.

## Our Philosophy

```javascript
const philosophy = {
  "ship": "today, not tomorrow",
  "build": "what doesn't exist",
  "solve": "real problems",
  "measure": "in working code"
};
```

- **Thursday = No Meeting Day** - We build instead of talk
- **20 Minute Rule** - If it takes longer than 20 minutes, we're overthinking
- **Ship > Perfect** - Working code beats perfect documentation
- **Open > Closed** - Share everything that helps developers

## Tech Stack

We use what works:
- **TypeScript** - Type safety matters
- **React/React Native** - One codebase, everywhere
- **Node.js** - JavaScript all the way down
- **MCP** - AI integration is the future
