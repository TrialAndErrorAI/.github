## We Are an AI Lab

Boston-based AI research and product laboratory. Founded November 2022 with a simple thesis: AI will transform every slice of human experience. We're not waiting for that future - we're building it.

What started as frustration with broken tools became a mission to reimagine how AI integrates into daily life. From architecture to voice, from automation to creation - we're systematically rebuilding the stack.

## What We Build

### üèóÔ∏è Open Source

#### [App Store Connect MCP](https://github.com/TrialAndErrorAI/appstore-connect-mcp)
*20 minutes from idea to production*  
The "official" MCP server didn't exist. Now it does. Connect your iOS metrics to Claude instantly.

### üé® AI Products in Production

#### [RenovateAI](https://renovateai.app) - The Architecture Intelligence
Revolutionary AI that understands space like humans do. **$3M+ ARR** ($260K MRR) and growing.
- **90% iOS revenue** - Where real users pay for real value
- **Computer vision meets design** - Teaching machines to see architecture
- **B2B platform emerging** - Transforming how professionals work

#### VoxAI - Voice Synthesis Platform
Your voice, any song. Celebrity impressions. Audio magic at your fingertips.
- **Voice cloning & transformation** 
- **AI music covers**
- **Stem separation technology**

#### ProcessBot - Intelligent Automation
Because repetitive work is a bug, not a feature.
- **Workflow automation**
- **AI-powered decision making**
- **Human-in-the-loop intelligence**

### üî¨ Research Areas

- **AGI Development** - Building agents that think, not just respond
- **Multimodal AI** - Vision, voice, and reasoning in harmony
- **AI-Native Interfaces** - UX that assumes intelligence
- **Economic Energy Flow** - How value moves through AI systems

## Our Philosophy

```javascript
const trialAndError = {
  "mission": "Build the foundation on which the work of life will be built",
  "approach": "Ship working AI today, not promises tomorrow",
  "metric": "Real users paying real money",
  "speed": "20 minutes to MVP",
  "scale": "Every slice of life enhanced by AI"
};
```

### Core Beliefs

- **AI-Native, Not AI-Added** - Built with intelligence from day one
- **Economic Energy Flow** - Money is energy; direct it wisely
- **Trial and Error Method** - Fail fast, learn faster, ship fastest
- **Thursday = Build Day** - No meetings, pure creation
- **Cash Flow is Oxygen** - Profitable from day one, not "someday"

### The Thesis

We believe AI will touch every moment of human experience. Not as an overlay, but as a foundation. Every app, every interaction, every decision - enhanced by machine intelligence working alongside human creativity.

We're not building tools. We're building the platform on which the future runs.

## Tech Stack

We use what works:
- **TypeScript** - Type safety matters
- **React/React Native** - One codebase, everywhere
- **Node.js** - JavaScript all the way down
- **MCP** - AI integration is the future
